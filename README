===============

Light-weight CT-API and PKCS#11 library for using the SmartCard-HSM in embedded systems

Purpose
-------
This module has been developed for facilitate the integration of a SmartCard-HSM in
embedded systems with a little footprint. Rather than using a PC/SC daemon to manage
attached card readers and token, the smaller Card Terminal API (CT-API) is used.

Supported Hardware
------------------
The module can be compiled for Linux and Windows. It supports the SmartCard-HSM USB-stick
and SmartCard-HSM cards inserted into an Identive SCR 3310 reader.

The ctccid module uses standard functions from the CCID specification, so the driver may work
with other CCID compliant readers as well. However, the only reader used during tests is
the SCR 3310 and the USB-stick.

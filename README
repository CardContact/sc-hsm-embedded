sc-hsm-embedded PKCS#11 Module
==============================

Light-weight, read-only PKCS#11 library for using the SmartCard-HSM in embedded systems.

The module also supports various signature cards commonly used in Germany.

Purpose
-------
This module has been developed to support the integration of a SmartCard-HSM in
embedded systems with a little footprint. Rather than using a PC/SC daemon to manage
attached card readers and token, the smaller Card Terminal API (CT-API) can be used.

Supported Hardware
------------------
The module can be compiled for Linux and Windows. It supports the SmartCard-HSM USB-stick
and SmartCard-HSM cards inserted into an Identive SCR 3310 reader.

The ctccid module uses standard functions from the CCID specification, so the driver may work
with other CCID compliant readers as well. However, the only reader used during tests is
the SCR 3310 and the USB-stick.

Installation (Linux)
--------------------
Download source and run configure, make, make install.

Installation (Windows)
----------------------
Install the provided .msi file or unpack the archive and copy the
sc-hsm-pkcs11.dll into the windows\systems32 directory or any
other directory that is included in the PATH.

Firefox
-------
Open Firefox and the Add-ons-Manager.
Select "Install Add-ons From File"
Select the file "sc-hsm-pkcs11.xpi"

Thunderbird
-----------
Open Thunderbird and the Security Devices Manager
Select Load and enter "SmartCard-HSM" as Module Name
Select "sc-hsm-pkcs.dll" or "/usr/local/lib/sc-hsm-pkcs11.so" as module filename.

Uninstall
---------
Open Firefox and the Add-ons-Manager.
Uninstall the "SmartCard-HSM PKCS#11 Installer"
Open the "Security Devices Manager"
Unload the entry under "SmartCard-HSM"

Windows64
---------
The win64 directory contains 64-bit versions of the PKCS#11 module and the
test program. Please remember that Firefox on Windows is generally a 32-bit
program.

Running the test program
------------------------
Open a console and change into the sc-hsm-pkcs11 directory.
Insert a SmartCard-HSM and enter

sc-hsm-pkcs11-test --module lib\sc-hsm-pkcs11.dll

For a STARCOS card you will need to define the token that shall be used for tests:

sc-hsm-pkcs11-test --module lib\sc-hsm-pkcs11.dll --token STARCOS.eUserPKI

The test program uses the default PINs (648219 for SmartCard-HSM or 123456 for STARCOS card).

Please use --pin <pin> if you need to define a different PIN.

Debugging
---------
A debugging version of the PKCS#11 module is provided to aid debugging of
card and card reader problems.

Please copy the sc-hsm-pkcs11-debug.dll onto the sc-hsm-pkcs11.dll and create
a directory c:\var\tmp\sc-hsm-embedded. Log files will be placed in that directory.

On Linux you will need to use configure with --enable-debug

Release 2.9
-----------
Added ATRs for BNotK cards

Release 2.8
-----------
Added support for ECC keys on DGN card
Added support for static slot ids
Fixed issue with leaked PIN value due to non-cleared buffers
Added multi-threading tests for ECC

Release 2.7
-----------
Added support for DGN HBA on Starcos 3.5

Release 2.6
-----------
Disabled QES token when running under Firefox.

Release 2.5
-----------
Added ATR for contactless SmartCard-HSMs.

Release 2.4
-----------
Removed probing of applications on unrecognized cards.

Release 2.3
-----------
Disabled QES2 on Signtrust 3.2 card as this is never used.
Added environment variable PKCS11_PREALLOCATE_VIRTUAL_SLOTS=<n> to create <n> virtual slots when the
primary slot is allocated for the first time. Without the flag a virtual slot is dynamically created if a
token with more than one PIN is detect. In that case the PKCS#11 module creates an additional virtual slot for
each additional PIN (usually the QES PINs). However, this dynamic behaviour collides with the way Firefox handles
the Friendly flag, which is only set for slots that are present at modul loading.

Release 2.2
-----------
